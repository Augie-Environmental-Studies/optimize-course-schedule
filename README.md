# What is this repository for?
This progeram's purpose is to find the optimal
time schedule for every course, and to do so
in a way that is beneficial for both the faculty
and students.

We designed this program such that it accepts
a Google Sheets file containing a list of all courses
for that semester, and then outputs the same Google Sheets file
with each course's time schedule filled in with
the optimal value calculated by machine learning.

<br>

***Specifications***<br>
- [ ] Has two different user interfaces: (a)
CLI for debugging purposes and also for people
who want to customize and (b) a web app built using
HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and React. The web app is
containerized with Docker and is designed to be
deployed with Docker Compose.
- [ ] Test server at https://foraugie.nsustain.com
- [ ] Production server at https://augie.nsustain.com
- [ ] It's important to use technology for solving the problem and
not the other way around -- we can sometimes make the mistake of
trying to solve a problem in order to use a technology we like.
Remember to focus on the problem, not on which technology to use.
- [ ] Again, start from the problem. Don't start from which cool, fancy library to use!
What is our problem and which library best solves the problem?

<br>

***Structure of the program***<br>
- [ ] Main optimization done using ... library in C++.
- [ ] Help data scraped using ... library in Python.
- [ ] Call Python code from the main driver written in C++ https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html#embedding-python-in-c

<br>

> - Let's try not to reinvent the wheel! If there's already an open-source project that does what we need, just using that open-source project is the best decision most of the time.
>
> - We expect this project to take at least six months because of the need for continuous testing. We will set up a continuous feedback loop from both the faculty and students so that this program truly serves its purpose.
